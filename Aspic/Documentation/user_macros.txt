User macros are available as command line entries during a Logix session.

The user macro commands supplied for Stochastic Pi Calculus include and 
in some cases replace the user macros of the Logix system.  They fall
into three major categories:

  * Channel management and message transmission;

  * Program execution;

  * Debugging.

In the discussion below, refer to BNF.txt for syntactic definition of
most bracketed terms, such as <logix_variable>.  Other bracketed
terms, such as <goals>, are defined in explicitly specified documents.

Channel Management and Message Transmission
-------------------------------------------

The user macros:

    pc(C)
    pc(C,S,B)
    pc(C,S,B,W)

are used to create channels.  The former user macro creates an "instantaneous"
(infinite rate) channel C.  The latter two create "based" channel C,whose
name is derived from the string S, and whose base rate is specified by
the non-negative number B (When B is 0, the created channel is a "sink" -
i.e. all sends and receives on the channel are discarded, and no actual
transmission occurs.).  The third specifies a <weighter_declaration> in
addition.


The user macros:

    ps(M,C)
    ps(M,C,N)

offer to send message M on channel C, where N is a positive integer multiplier;
the likelihood that C will be selected for transmission increases with N.


The user macros:

    pr(C,M)
    pr(C,M,N)

offer to receive message M on channel C, where N is a positive integer
multiplier, as above.


The user macro:

    weighter(W)

sets the default weight computation.  W  is a <weighter_decaration>.


Program Execution
-----------------

The basic Logix command to execute a program has the form:

    <directory path>#<goal>

The system creates a computation, uniquely identified by a positive
integer, its "computation number", throughout the session.  The command
starts a Logix computation, redefining the "current computation" and
the "current computation number".


To execute a Stochastic Pi Calculus program, e.g. RunTT in module booland
in directory boolean, call:

    boolean#booland#"RunTT"

The call above is an example of a Remote Process Call (RPC).

The quotation marks around RunTT are necessary, since the Logix system
treats names beginning with a capital letter or an underscore as logic
variables.


The user macros:

    run(<goals>)
    run(<goals>, <limit>)

execute all of the goals as a single computation: the first form continues
indefinitely; the second continues until <limit> units of internal time have 
elapsed.  See  repeat.txt  for details on specification of multiple goals.


The user macro:

    record(<goals>, <file name>, <limit>)

also executes all of the goals until <limit>, and records their behavior
on the named file.  See  repeat.txt  for details on specification of
multiple goals.  See  record.txt  for details about the file and about
the arguments of the user macro.


A computation may be  suspended ,  resumed  or  aborted.  You may also
inspect its resolvent - the set of unterminated processes (see Debugging
below).

The user macros:

    s
    suspend
    s(all)
    suspend(all)
    s(N)
    suspend(N)

suspend the current or the specified computation(s) (N or all).  The last
two forms also reset the current computation number.


The user macros:

    re
    resume
    re(all)
    resume(all)
    re(N)
    resume(N)

resume the current or the specified computation(s), as above.


The user macros:

    a
    abort
    a(all)
    abort(all)
    a(N)
    abort(N)
    
abort the current or the specified computation(s), as above.


Debugging
---------

Debugging aids consist of inspection and execution control user macros.


The user macros:

    options(New)
    options(New,Old)

set new display control options and (optionally) return old ones.
New  may be a single option or a Logix list of options.

  * none	Don't annotate any channels.
  * active	only annotate channels with both sends and receives.
  * messages    Display each transmitting channel with a list of messages.
                The messages option may be useful for debugging.
  * note        annotate channels which are transmitting;
		this is the usual default.

  * base        show channel name * base.
  * creator     show the creator of the channel and its unique index (if any).
  * full        combines base and creator
  * short       just show channel name; this is the usual default.

An example list is:

    [active,full]

In the user macros below, options may be specified explicitly in one variant
of most groups.  When the options are specified, they override the
global options set by the options user macro above.


The user macros:

   spg
   spg(N)
   spg(N,Options)

display the goals of the current or of the specified computation.  The last
two forms also reset the current computation number.


The user macros:

   spr
   spr(N)
   spr(N,Options)

display the resolvent of the current or of the specified computation, as above.


The user macros:

    spc(C)
    spc(C,Options)

display the channel C.


The user macros:

    pdb(RPC)
    pdb(RPC,Options)

start debugging of the Remote Process Call (e.g. hysteresis#"MODULE").
The debugger provides help in reponse to the command "help".


The user macro:

    vtree(Path,Goal,Tree)

executes Goal, with respect to Path and prepares Tree, which may be
displayed using user macros below.  For example, if Path is boolean#booland
and goal is "RunTT", Tree represents the execution of the RPC:

    boolean#booland#"RunTT"

Ordinarily, you should wait until the system becomes idle, or the
computation has been suspended before attempting to view Tree.

To view Tree, use either of the user macros:

    ptree(Tree)
    ptree(Tree,Options)

The default option for annotations to be displayed is "none" instead of "note".
Additional options which may be specified are:

  * prefix	Display Tree in prefix order; this is the default.
  * execute	Display Tree in execution order.


The user macro:

    ctree(Tree)

may be used to close the execution tree; this terminates the system's
participation in the execution of the computation.


Miscellaneous User Macros
-------------------------

The user macros:

    i(Path)
    input(Path)

Input the command file designated by Path.  For example to execute
the commands contained in the file test in sub-directory scripts:

    input(scripts#test)


The user macro:

    {<logix string>}

may be used to execute a UNIX command directly.  Examples:

    {ls}
    {"cat notes"}


The user macro:

    ^

may be used to display all named Logix variables.


The user macro:

    <logix_variable>^

may be used to display a named variable.


The user macro:

    unbind

may be used to remove the current definitions of all Logix variables.


The user macro:

    unbind(<logix_variable>)

may be used to remove the current definition of all <logix_variable>.
