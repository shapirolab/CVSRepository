The repeat process can run a quantified set of Stochastic Pi Calculus (spifcp)
processes.

    repeat#run(<quantified process set>)

where:

    <quantified process set> ::=
	<external_call>
        [<process set>]
        <repetition> * [<process set>]

    <process set> ::=
        <quantified process set>
        <process set> , <quantified process set>

    <repetition> ::= <integer>

See BNF.txt for the definition of <external_call>.

The square brackets may be omitted in the case where <process set>
is simply an <external_call>.

A negative <repetition> is treated as zero.


Examples:

1. repeat#run(64*dimerization#"A_PROTEIN")

2. repeat#run([6*activator#"A_PROTEIN",activator#"A_GENE",
                  repressor#"R_GENE"])

3. repeat#run([2*[activator#"A_GENE",3*repressor#"R_GENE"],
               hysteresis#"MODULE"])

This process is used by the run and record macros (see record.txt).
