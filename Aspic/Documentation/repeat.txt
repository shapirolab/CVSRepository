The repeat process can run a quantified set of Stochastic Pi Calculus
(spifcp)
processes.

    repeat#run(<quantified process set>)

where:

    <quantified process set> ::=
    <remote procedure call>
        <repetition> * <remote procedure call>
        [<process set>]
        <repetition> * [<process set>]

    <process set> ::=
        <quantified process set>
        <process set> , <quantified process set>

    <remote procedure call> ::=
        <service name> # <goal>
	<service name> # [<goal list>]
        <service name> # <remote_procedure_call>
	
    <goal list> ::=
        <repeated goal>
        <repeated goal> , <goal list>

    <repeated goal> ::=
        <goal>
        <repetition> * <goal>

    <repetition> ::= <integer>

A negative <repetition> is treated as zero.


Examples:

1. repeat#run(64*dimerization#"A_PROTEIN")

2. repeat#run([6*activator#"A_PROTEIN",activator#"A_GENE",
                  repressor#"R_GENE"])

3. repeat#run([2*[activator#"A_GENE",3*repressor#"R_GENE"],
               hysteresis#"MODULE"])

This process is used by the run, record and trace macros (see record.txt).

4. atrace(porinN#[4*"Mole", 2*"Cell"], file, 10)
