When a <logix_variable> appears in the <public_declaration>, its value
is shared with the variable of the same name declared in the user
interface of the Logix system.  Thus the variables X,Y declared in the
user interface:

  @X = 777
  @Y = michaelis

share the values 777,"michaelis" with the <logix_variable>s X,Y declared
in the <public_declaration> of a <program>:

  public(X,Y).

Such a "public" variable is an implicit argument of every process in the
program.

It may be used in place of:

     <base_rate> in the <default_baserate_declaration> or in any
     <channel_declaration>;

     <weighter> in any <channel_declaration>;

     <weighter_parameter> in any <weighter_parameter_list>.

The value of the public variable should agree in type and constraint
with the replaced argument.

See BNF.txt for the full syntax and constraints.

Examples:

1. @X = 1.4

  baserate(X).
  public(X, a).

  A + b :: a ! {b} , b ? [] , 0 .

2. @X = 1.4
   @Y = michaelis
   @Z = 7

   public(a, X, Y, Z).

   A ::= {Z > 0} , << b(X, Y(Z)) . a ! {b} , {Z--} , A >> ;
         {Z = 0} , 0 .

  Note that in this example, the first instance of A declares and
  sends the local channel b with "michaelis" argument 7, while
  subsequent iterations use the computed values of Z.
