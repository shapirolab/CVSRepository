Channels with finite rates are weighted for selection using the
following default computations.  When a multiplier is not specified
explicitly in a <transmission>, it defaults to 1.

  bimolecular weight =
                (baserate of channel) *
          (sum of <send> multipliers) * (sum of <receive> multipliers)

  homodimerized weight =
                (baserate of channel) *
        ((sum of <dimer> multipliers) * (sum of <dimer> multipliers - 1))/2

These computations are based on the analysis in "Exact stochastic
simulation of coupled chemical reaction", D.T. Gillespie, Journal of
Physical Chemistry, volume 81, pps 2340-2361.


The user may specify custom computations using the notation for
<weighter_declaration> in Documentation/BNF; the computation must
be explicitly coded in the module Logix/<emulator name>/spiweight.c .


The default <weighter_declaration> for a Stochastic Pi Calculus session
may be changed dynamically by a user macro call:

    weighter(<weighter_declaration>)

See user_macros.txt for details.
