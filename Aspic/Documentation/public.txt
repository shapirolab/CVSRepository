In Pi Calculus, as defined by Milner, global channels may be declared
implicitly by reference.  In this implementation of Stochastic Pi
Calculus, they must be declared explicitly for each module in which
they are referenced.  They are shared between all modules.

The declaration has the form:

    public(<stochastic_channel_list>).

See Documentation/BNF.

See the modules in Examples/boolean and in Examples/circadian.
