The directory boolean contains a set of modules which perform
boolean and or boolean not on selected inputs.  To run the
boolean not test, e.g. :

    % cd boolean
    % logix
    @tnot#"RunT"

To run the boolean and test, e.g. :

    @tand#"RunTF"

Note that the tests, tand#"RunFT" and tand#"RunFF" do not
terminate normally - to inspect the state, enter:

    @spr

To force termination, enter:

    @abort

(or just @a - see @ph).


The directory circadian contains a set of modules which implement
a Circadian Clock.  To compile the entire set:

    % logix
    @c(circadian)

In case of abrupt termination of the Logix System during compilation
or execution, with the message:

    garbage collection - end : MACHINE : Heap Overflow

try running the system with a larger heap, e.g. :

    % logix -h20000
    @c(circadian)

To execute the compiled application, with a 1000 unit time limit
and output to file fff:

    @record(circadian#go,fff,1000)
    @abort
    @<control>G

See Documentation/record.txt for information about the output file.
