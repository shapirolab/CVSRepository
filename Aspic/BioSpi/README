This directory may be used as a base for the development of Ambient
Stochastic Pi Calculus Programs.source

The "executable" of the user macros for the ambient version is in Bin.
If you need to use another directory for development, link or copy the
module Bin/user_macros.bin to that directory (or its Bin sub-directory),
or to a directory which is between the scopes of that directory
and your home directory,

The Source directory contains the source of the additions to aspic which
implement Ambients.

The module Source/user_macros.cp defines the user macros of BioSpi.  Try
command "ph" for a list of user macros.  These user macros apply to
source files written in language(biospi).  For further information about
the user macros see the documents named user_macros.txt in Documentation
sub-directories.

The other modules in Source are the service that manages the Ambient
tree (ambient_server.cp) and a module which implements the user macro
"atrace" (ambient_list.cp) - see Documentation/trace.txt for details.

The biospi sub-directory of Source contains the program which transforms
modules written in language(spifcp) into Logix source programs written
in language(compound).

Some examples of Ambient Stochastic Pi Calculus programs are included in
sub-directory, Examples.
