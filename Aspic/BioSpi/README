This directory should serve as a base for testing biospi programs.
It includes the source of the additions to aspic which implement
Ambients.

The "executables" of the source are in sub-directory Bin.  If you
need to use another directory for development, soft link the sub-
directory Bin, or copy the Bin to it or to one of its enclosing
directories which is within your home directory,

The module user_macros.cp defines the user macros of BioSpi.  Try
command "ph" for a list of user macros.  For further information
about the user macros see the documents named user_macros.txt in
the Documentation sub-directories.

The files in Bin are the "executable" forms of the source.  Two are
linked to files of the same name in Aspic-release/Logix/system/Bin,
and they should not be recompiled here without breaking the link.
The file ambient_server.bin implements the ambient management process.
The file ambient_trace.bin implements the user macro "atrace" - see
Documentation/trace.txt for details.
