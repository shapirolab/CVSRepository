This directory should serve as a base for testing biospi programs.
It includes the source of the additions to aspic which implement
Ambients.

The "executables" of the source are in sub-directory Bin.  If you
need to use another directory for development, link or copy the
module Bin/user_macros.bin to that directory (or its Bin sub-directory),
or to a directory which is between the scopes of that directory
and your home directory,

The module user_macros.cp defines the user macros of BioSpi.  Try
command "ph" for a list of user macros.  These user macros apply to
source files written in language(biospi).  For further information
about the user macros see the documents named user_macros.txt in the
Documentation sub-directories.

The modules in Bin are the "executable" forms of the source.  Three are
linked to modules of the same name in Aspic-release/Logix/system/Bin,
and they should not be recompiled here without breaking the link,
unless you intend to replace the version of that module which may be
accessed from outside the scope of this directory.

The module ambient_server.bin implements the ambient management process.

The module ambient_list.bin implements the user macro "atrace" - see
Documentation/trace.txt for details.

The module ambient_trace.bin is an obsolescent form of ambient_list.bin.


Some examples of Ambient Stochastic Pi Calculus programs are included in
sub-directory, Examples.
