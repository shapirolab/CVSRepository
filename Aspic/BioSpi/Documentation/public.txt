In Pi Calculus, as defined by Milner, global channels may be declared
implicitly by reference.  In this implementation of Ambient Stochastic Pi
Calculus, they must be declared explicitly for each module in which they
are referenced.  They are shared within an Ambient by all modules in which
they are declared; they are not shared between Ambients, although they may
be merged when two ambients merge.

The declaration has the form:

    public(<stochastic_channel_list>).
