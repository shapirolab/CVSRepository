The ambient_trace process can run an Ambient Stochastic Pi Calculus
(spifcp) process and trace the behavior of its ambients.

   ambient_trace#run(<call program>, <file_name>, <time limit>)

If the <time limit> argument is omitted, the program runs until it
terminates or is aborted.  A list of all ambient trees recorded
during the run is then written to the file and to another file with
the prefix file name and the suffix ".list".  The second file is a
list of one line per tree of all of the ambient trees.  Each node
in a tree which has any sub-tree, is followed by a list of the
sub-tree nodes enclosed in square brackets - e.g.

    [system(3.486569), [public(1), [molecule(3), cell(2), [membrane(4)]]]]

The fixed-point value indexing the first node, is the internal time
at which the tree was last modified.

The file name may be omitted as well, or represented by the empty
string (""), in which case the trees (in normal indented format) are
displayed following termination of the program.

This process is obsolescent, having been replaced by ambient_list,
which may be called by the user macro atrace (see user_macros.txt).
