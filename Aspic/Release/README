of Stochastic Pi Calculus.  Its Source sub-directory contains the
source of the implementation.  The Examples sub-directory contains
examples of programs written in language(spifcp) .  The Documentation
sub-directory contains the BNF of Stochastic Pi Calculus and other
notes specific to it.

The BioSpi directory supports applications written in dialect biospi
of Ambient Stochastic Pi Calculus.  Its Source sub-directory contains
the source of the extension to Ambient Stochasic Pi Calculus.  The
sub-directory contains examples of programs written in language(biospi).
The Documentation sub-directory contains the BNF of Ambient Stochastic
Pi Calculus and other notes specific to it.

The files in bin are used to extract tabular information from a
(Ambient) Stochastic Pi Calculus application session (see record.txt
in sub-directory SpiFcp/Documentation).  You may find it useful to
copy or to link them to your ~/bin directory.

The Tutorial directory contains a tutorial of the system.  It also
contains some simple examples which are referenced in the tutorial.

The Logix directory contains the operating syatem which underlies the
BioSpi system.  To complete installation, follow the directions in
Logix/README.
