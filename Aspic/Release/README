The Logix system may be installed on linux, sgi and solaris
platforms.  To (re)install the Logix system (e.g. on a linux
platform):

    % cd Logix
    % ./install LINUX -h20000

To install on an sgi or solaris platform, substitute SGI or
SOLARIS for LINUX.

The generated file may be used to start a Logix session on the
appropriate platform - e.g.s:

    % Logix/linux_logix
    % Logix/sgi_ligix
    % Logix/solaris_logix

However, do NOT run the system from within the Logix Directory,
nor from within any of its sub-directories.

During a Logix session, enter:

    @h

for Logix help, or:

    @ph

for Stochastic Pi Calculus help.  See user_macros.txt in sub-
directory Documentation for details about the user macros.

The Documentation file includes Stochastic Pi Calculus BNF and
various notes.  The notes also apply in most part to Ambient
Stochastic Pi Calculus.

The files in bin are used to extract tabular information from a
Stochastic Pi Calculus application session (see record.txt in
sub-directory Documentation).  The files in Bin are utilities.
To make these files generally available, copy them to the
directories of the same names in your home directory.

Some examples of Stochastic Pi Calculus programs are included in
its sub-directory,  Examples.

The BioSpi sub-directory supports applications written in Ambient
Stochastic Pi Calculus, including examples in its sub-directory,
Examples.  It also has a sub-directory, Documentation, which
contains the BNF of Ambient Stochastic Pi Calculus and other
notes specific to it.
