The Logix system may be installed on linux, macosx, sgi and
solaris platforms.  To (re)install the Logix system (e.g. on a
linux platform):

    % cd Logix
    % ./install LINUX -h20000

To install on a macosx, sgi or solaris platform, substitute
MACOSX, SGI or SOLARIS for LINUX.

The generated file may be used to start a Logix session on the
appropriate platform - e.g.s:

    % Logix/linux_logix
    % Logix/macosxx_logix
    % Logix/sgi_logix
    % Logix/solaris_logix

However, do NOT run the system from within the Logix Directory,
nor from within any of its sub-directories.

During a Logix session, enter:

    @h

for Logix help, or:

    @ph

for Stochastic Pi Calculus help.  See user_macros.txt in sub-
directory SpiFcp/Documentation and in BioSpi/Documentation for
details about the user macros.

The SpiFcp sub-directory supports applications written in dialect
"spifcp" of Stochastic Pi Calculus.  It includes the source of
the implementation, and examples in sub-directory Examples.  It
also has a sub-directory, Documentation, which contains the BNF of
Stochastic Pi Calculus and other notes specific to it.

The BioSpi sub-directory supports applications written in dialect
biospi of Ambient Stochastic Pi Calculus, including examples in its
sub-directory, Examples.  It also has a sub-directory, Documentation,
which contains the BNF of Ambient Stochastic Pi Calculus and other
notes specific to it.

The files in bin are used to extract tabular information from a
(Ambient) Stochastic Pi Calculus application session (see record.txt
in sub-directory SpiFcp/Documentation).
