The SpiFcp sub-directory supports applications written in dialect
"spifcp" of Stochastic Pi Calculus.  It includes the source of
the implementation, and examples in sub-directory Examples.  It
also has a sub-directory, Documentation, which contains the BNF of
Stochastic Pi Calculus and other notes specific to it.

The BioSpi sub-directory supports applications written in dialect
biospi of Ambient Stochastic Pi Calculus, including examples in its
sub-directory, Examples.  It also has a sub-directory, Documentation,
which contains the BNF of Ambient Stochastic Pi Calculus and other
notes specific to it.  When running programs which have been written
in language(biospi), if the current (UNIX) directory is outside of
the scope of Aspic-release/BioSpi, copy or link the file
Aspic-release/BioSpi/Bin/user_macros.bin to the current directory
or to a directory which contains it, or to the Bin sub-directory of
either.

The files in bin are used to extract tabular information from a
(Ambient) Stochastic Pi Calculus application session (see record.txt
in sub-directory SpiFcp/Documentation).  You may find it useful to
copy or to link them to your ~/bin directory.

The Tutorial directory contains a tutorial of the system.  It also
contains some simple examples which are referenced in the tutorial.

The Logix directory contains the operating syatem which underlies the
BioSpi system.  To complete installation, follow the directions in
Logix/README.
