The Logix system may be installed on cygwin, linux, macosx, sgi and
solaris platforms.  To (re)install the Logix system (e.g. on a linux
platform):

    % cd Logix
    % ./install LINUX

To install on a cygwin, maci386, macosx, sgi or solaris platform,
substitute CYGWIN, MACI386, MACOSX, SGI or SOLARIS for LINUX.

The generated file may be used to start a Logix session on the
appropriate platform - e.g.s:

    % Logix/cygwin_logix
    % Logix/linux_logix
    % Logix/maci386_logix
    % Logix/macosx_logix
    % Logix/sgi_logix
    % Logix/solaris_logix

However, do NOT run the system from within the Logix Directory,
nor from within any of its sub-directories.

During a Logix session, enter:

    @h

for Logix help, or:

    @ph

for Stochastic Pi Calculus help.  See user_macros.txt in directory
SpiFcp/Documentation for details about the user macros, or directory
BioSpi/Documentation for details of the user macros of the Ambient
Stochastic Pi Calculus.
