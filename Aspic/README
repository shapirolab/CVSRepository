The Documentation directory includes Stochastic Pi Calculus BNF
and various notes.  The notes also apply in most part to Ambient
Stochastic Pi Calculus.

The source of the Stochastic Pi Calculus system (not including
the Logix system) is in this directory.  The modules of the
system are written in FCP dialect "compound" or in multiplex
dialect [evaluate, compound, colon], except for spi_constants.cp,
which is included and evaluated in may modules.  See chapter 7 of
Aspic-release/Documentation/supplement.mss for further information
about dialects of FCP.

The module user_macros.cp defines the user macros of SpiFcp.
See user_macros.txt in sub-directory Documentation for details
about the user macros.

The files in Bin are the compiled forms of the source.  They are
linked to files of the same name in Aspic-release/Logix/system/Bin,
and they should not be recompiled here without breaking the link.

Some examples of Stochastic Pi Calculus programs are included in
sub-directory, Examples.
