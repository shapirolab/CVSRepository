The Documentation directory includes Stochastic Pi Calculus BNF
and various notes.  The notes also apply in most part to Ambient
Stochastic Pi Calculus.

The source of the Stochastic Pi Calculus system (not including
the Logix system) is in this directory.  The modules of the
system are written in FCP dialect "compound" or in multiplex
dialect [evaluate, compound, colon], except for spi_constants.cp,
which is included and evaluated in many modules.  See chapter 7
of supplement.mss for further information about dialects of FCP.

The module user_macros.cp defines the user macros of SpiFcp.
These user macros apply to modules written in language(spifcp).
See user_macros.txt in sub-directory Documentation for details
about the user macros.

The modules in Bin are the compiled forms of the source.  Those
.bin modules which are linked to Aspic-release/Logix/system/Bin,
should not be recompiled here without breaking the link, unless
you intend to replace the version of that module which may be
accessed from outside the scope of this directory.

Some examples of Stochastic Pi Calculus programs are included in
sub-directory, Examples.
