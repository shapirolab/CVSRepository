The Documentation directory includes Stochastic Pi Calculus BNF
and various notes.  The notes also apply in most part to Ambient
Stochastic Pi Calculus.

The source of the Stochastic Pi Calculus system (not including
the Logix system) is in the Source directory.  The modules of
the system are written in FCP dialect "compound" or in multiplex
dialect [evaluate, compound, colon], except for spi_constants.cp,
which is included and evaluated in many modules.  See chapter 7
of supplement.mss for further information about dialects of FCP.

The module user_macros.cp defines the user macros of SpiFcp.
These user macros apply to modules written in language(spifcp).
See user_macros.txt in sub-directory Documentation for details
about the user macros.

The Source directory contains sub-directory spifcp: spifcp contains
the programs which tranform modules in language(spifcp) into Logix
source programs in language(compound).

Some examples of Stochastic Pi Calculus programs are included in
directory, Examples.
