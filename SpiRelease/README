The Logix system may be installed on linux, sgi and solaris
platforms.  To install the Logix system (e.g. on a linux
platform):

    % cd Logix
    % install LINUX -h20000

To install on an sgi or solaris platform, substitute SGI or
SOLARIS for LINUX.

The generated file may be used to start a Logix session on the
appropriate platform - e.g.s:

    % Logix/linux_logix
    % Logix/sgi_ligix
    % Logix/solaris_logix

However, do NOT run the system from within the Logix Directory,
nor from within any of its sub-directories.

During a Logix session, enter:

    @h

for Logix help, or:

    @ph

for Stochastic Pi Calculus help.

The Documentation file includes Stochastic Pi Calculus BNF and
various notes.

The files in bin are used to extract tabular information from a
Stochastic Pi Calculus application session (see record.txt).

Some examples of Stochastic Pi Calculus programs are included
in sub-directory Examples.

The BioSpi sub-directory supports applications written in Ambient
Stochastic Pi Calculus, including examples in its sub-directory
Examples.
