This directory should serve as a base for testing biospi programs.
If you need to use another directory for development, soft link
the sub-directory Bin to it or to one of its enclosing directories
which is within your home directory.

The file ambient_server.bin is the "executable" of the ambient
management process.  The file user_macros.bin provides useful
macros for biospi - try command "ph" for help. See user_macros.txt
in sub-directories Documentation and ../Documentation for details
about the user macros.
