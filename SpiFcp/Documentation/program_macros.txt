Program macros may be called in the <body> of a Stochastic Pi Calculus
program.  They have the general form:

    <program_macro_name>(<program_macro_arguments>)

    <program_macro_arguments> ::= <logix_variable>
                                  <program_input_arguments>
                                  <program_input_arguments> , <logix_variable>

    <program_input_arguments> ::= <simple_logix_arguments>
                                  <channels>
                                  <simple_logix_arguments> , <channels>

    <simple_logix_arguments>  ::= <integer>
                                  <real>
                                  <string>
                                  []
                                  <logix_variable>?

    <channels>                ::= <channel>
                                  <channel> , <channels>

Where a <real> is designated, an <integer> or a <string> representing a
real value may appear - it is converted to the correspondig real vale before
the macro is performed.

A read-only variable (<logix_variable>?) may appear in place of any of the
<simple_logix_arguments>.  The <logix_variable> must be instantiated before
the macoro can be performed.

The <logix_variable> is optional.  Unless otherwise indicated, it is set
to  true  when the macro is successfully completed.


The following program macros are defined.

  set_base_rate(<real> , <channels> , <logix_variable>)

The baserate of each of the designated channels is set to the the real value.
If the first argument is not (convertible to) real, the <logix_variable> is
set to  false(<non_real>, [<channels>]) .

  randomize_messages(<channels> , <logix_variable>)

Each of the designated channels is set to randomly select send and receive
(or two dimer) offers to be completed, when the channel is chosen for 
transmission.

  serialize_messages(<channels> , <logix_variable>)

Each of the designated channels is set to select a send and a receive (or two
dimer) offers to be completed on a first-come-first-served basis when the 
channel is chosen for transmission.
