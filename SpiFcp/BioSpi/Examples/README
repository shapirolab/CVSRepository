The .cp modules in this directory may be compiled automatically and executed -
e.g.

    run(eg1#"Cytoplasm",20)

The sub-directories vesicle and complex may be compiled and executed - e.g.

    c(complex)
    run(#"System",10)

You may also compile and record the output:

    record(eg1#"Cytoplasm",eee,20)

or compile and record the output:

    c(complex)
    record(#"System",ccc,10)

Note that a module is only compiled automatically, if its corresponding .bin
file is older than the .cp file.  Sub-directories are never compiled
automatically.
