This directory should serve as a base for testing biospi programs.
If you need to use another directory for development, soft link
the sub-directory Bin to it or to one of its enclosing directories
which is within your home directory.

The file ambient_server.bin is the "executable" of the ambient
management process.  The file user_macros.bin provides useful
user macros for using biospi - try command "ph" for a list of user
macros.
