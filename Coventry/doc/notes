1. Set nice for process on SGI using:

      setpriority(PRIO_PROCESS, <pid>, <nice>-20);

   0 <= <nice> <= 40

2. Get a list of processes and their states using (System V):

      ps -A -o user,nice,time,pid,pgid,class,comm=...

   Results are "print"ed in 7 columns (separated by 1 or more spaces).

      <user> is alphanumeric.

      0 <= <nice> <= 40  or it is a 2-letter mnemonic for a scheduling queue
                         (SGI only?).

      <time> has format [[<days>-]<hours>:]<minutes>:<seconds>

         <days> and <hours> are greater than 0 (if present)
         <minutes> one or two digits (may be "0")
         <seconds> is two digits

      0 < <pid> < MAXPID      // sys/param.h

      0 < <pgid> < MAXPID     // sys/param.h

   The option "-a" may be used instead of "-A" to get a reduced list of
   processes.

3. To get the actual nice value when <nice> is a queue mnemonic, use:

      <nice> = getpriority(PRIO_PROCESS,  <pid>) + 20;

   This is only useful for the GN queue; note that the nice value is
   ignored in scheduling processes in the GN queue.

4. In addition to ignoring a list of users , we should also ignore (possibly 
   empty) lists of, queues and commands.  All lists  should be keyed
   arguments of the daemon's launch (later), with appropriate defaults:

      users:     (daemon, root, 60001, ...)
      queues:    (OS, RT, ...)
      commands:  (bash, bsh, csh, sh, tcsh, ...)

5. For monitoring Gang scheduled processes on SGI, the method schedctl
   may be used to get/set their non-deteriorating priorities - see
   c-apps, getndpri.c, setndpri.c and the schedctl man page.
