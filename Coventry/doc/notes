1. Set nice for process on SGI using:

      npri -p <pid> -n <nice>

   0 <= <nice> <= 39

2. Get a list of processes and their states using:

      ps -A -o user=,pid=,nice=,time=

   Results are "print"ed in 4 columns (separated by 1 or more spaces).

      <user> is alphanumeric.

      0 < <pid> < MAXPID      // sys/param.h

      0 <= <nice> < 39  or it is a 2-letter mnemonic for a scheduling queue.

      <time> has format [[<days>-]<hours>:]<minutes>:<seconds>

         <days> and <hours> are greter than 0 (if present)
         <minutes> one or two digits (may be "0")
         <seconds> is two digits

   The option "-a" may be used instead of "-A" to get a reduced list of
   processes.

3. To get the actual nice value when <nice> is a queue mnemonic, use:

      <nice> = schedctl(GETNICE_PROC, <pid>);  // sys/schedctl.h

   The result is a single line string of the form:

      "nice = #"

   This is implemented as a small c application, nices.c, which returns the 
   relative nice value (in range 0..39) of a given process.  It can also be 
   used to set the nice value of a given process.

4. In addition to ignoring a list of users , we should also ignore (possibly 
   empty) list of groups, queues and applications.  All lists  should be 
   keyed arguments of the daemon's launch, with appropriate defaults:

      users:     (daemon, root, 60001, ...)
      groups:    (staff, system, wheel, ...)
      queues:    (OS, RT, ...)
      commands:  (bash, bsh, csh, sh, tcsh, ...)
