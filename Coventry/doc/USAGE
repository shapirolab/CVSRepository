Coventry is a daemon which monitors and re-nices processes in the
TS (time-sharing) queue, so as to provide fair scheduling and more
efficient use of the processors.

It monitors the queue periodically, relegating processes which are
using too much processor time to less favorable nice classes.  When
more than one such "greedy" process is being executed by the same
user, at most one may execute in each nice class - the others are 
sent to "coventry" (the least favorable class).

Certain users and processes are exempt from this scheduling.  These
are listed in the coventryd daemon, declared as PERL hashes, %users
and %commands.

The script coventry may be used to start and stop coventryd.

    coventry start
and
    coventry stop

You may also run coventryd directly.  To do so you should be root,
and the directory of coventryd, /usr/local/sbin,  should be in the 
PATH environment variable, or you should call it with its full path
name, /usr/local/sbin/coventryd.  When running coventryd directly you 
may  use the option "-Q" or "-Q#" to query the states of processes, 
where "#" in minutes is the  lower bound of elapsed time of processes
to be displayed - the  default is 1 minute.  Processes are displayed:

    <user>(<nice value>) - <elapsed time> - <command>(<process id>)

The query option must be the first argument, if it is present at all.
Other arguments are used as options for System V ps (default "-A").
The option:

    -o <fields>

is used by coventryd when calling ps, and should not be included.

Example:

    coventryd -Q4 -u bill,leah,schramm

To debug coventryd, set the environment variable:

    setenv DEBUG_COVENTRY 1

See the document DEBUG in this directory for further information about
debugging.


Coventry may be freely started and stopped.  When stopped, any process
which is in "coventry" is returned to the last class/priority which it
occupied prior to being sent to "coventry".  You may stop coventryd 
with any of the signals INT, QUIT, TERM (2, 3, 15).
