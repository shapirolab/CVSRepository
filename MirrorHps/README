The script "mhomepages" uses mirror to copy home
pages to bach.  It must be run as root, in order 
to mirror the homepages of specific machines.
It should be run on the machine whose disk is
is to have its home pages mirrored.

However, it can be run:

    mhomepages <machine name>

when the machine in question does not support perl
or mirror correctly (cymbal, harp, horn, lachesis,
bina, wisdom); the last two machines do not have
any real user home directories, so they should be
excluded in any case.

The script "auto_homes" may be called to spawn
instances of mhomepages.  The remaining machines
are called remotely to perform the specified
action.  When called with the option:

   -e<machine name list>

the named machines are excluded.  When called
with the option:

   -s<machine name list>

the named machines are served locally by the
machine running the script.  The action must be
named.  See mupdate for examples. 

The file mirror_defaults contains the common data
required for mirroring.  See the man page of mirror
for details.
