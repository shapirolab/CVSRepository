By default, processes of this implementation of Stochastic Pi
Calculus, run with a base rate "infinite" - i.e. communication
is instantaneous, whenever a send and receive are active for
the same channel.

To set the default base rate for all of the processes in a module
include the psifcp attribute:

    baserate(<default rate>).

Declared channels may be specified with explicit base rates (see
Documentation/BNF).

See the modules in Examples/circadian.
