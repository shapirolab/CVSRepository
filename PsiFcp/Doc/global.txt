In Pi Calculus, as defined by Milner, global channels may be declared
implicitly by reference.  In this implementation of Stochastic Pi
Calculus, global channels must be declared explicitly for each module
in which they are referenced.

The declaration has the form:

    global(<stochastic_channel_list>).

See Documentation/BNF.

See the modules in Examples/boolean and in Examples/circadian.
