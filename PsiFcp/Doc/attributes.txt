Logix attributes are specified at the head of each module in the form:

    -<attribute name>.
or
    -<attribute name>(<arguments>).


A required attribute for Stochastic Pi Calculus modules is:

    -language([psifcp,compound,colon]).

The names in the list specify transformations to be applied to the
module as part of compilation.  The transformation, psifcp, transforms
modules written in Stochastic Pi Calculus into modules in the
compound dialect of LOGIX.


An optional attribute is:

    -export(<process name>).
or
    -export([<process name list>]).

The export attribute specifies which processes may be called by RPC
(Remote Process Call).  If omitted, all first level processes are
callable.

Each process name must be quoted.  See the modules in Examples/boolean
and in Examples/circadian.


An optional attribute is:

    -mode(<execution mode>).

where <execution mode> is one of:

    interpret
    interrupt
    failsafe
    trust

To debug a module, it must be compiled in interpret mode - this is
the default mode.

To inspect the process resolvent during execution, or to suspend
execution of its processes, or to abort the execution of its
processes, a module must be compiled in interpret or interrupt
mode.  Mode interrupt is substantially faster than mode interpret.
Modes failafe and trust are somewhat faster than interrupt, but
should only be used for modules whose processes are self-terminating.


An optional attribute is:

    -include(<module name>).

The content of the named module is inserted following the attributes.
This is useful primarily for including definitions of named values.
See the modules in Examples/circadian, some of which include module
rates.  Note that the definitions are implemented by the transformation
evaluate, which is specified in the language attribute of those modules,
i.e.

    -language([evaluate,psifcp,compound,colon]).
