The repeat process can run a quantified set of Pi Calculus (psifcp)
processes.

    repeat#run(<quantified process set>)

where:

    <quantified process set> ::=
	<external call>
        (<process set>)
        <repetition> * (<process set>)

    <process set> ::=
        <quantified process set>
        <process set> , <quantified process set>

    <repetition> ::= <integer>

A negative <repetition> is treated as zero.

(See BNF for the definition of <external_call>.)


The repeat macro can run the processes, and it can also measure
and record their behavior.

Examples:

1. repeat(64*(dimerization#"A_PROTEIN"))

2. repeat([6*(activator#"A_PROTEIN"),activator#"A_GENE",repressor#"R_GENE"])

3. repeat([2*[activator#A_GENE,3*(repressor#R_GENE)],hysteresis#module])

4. repeat(4*(dimerization#"A_PROTEIN"), 100)

5. repeat(4*(dimerization#"A_PROTEIN"), file, 100)

Note that the parentheses are necessary in the case of:

    <repetition>*(<external_call>)

Examples 4 and 5 terminate after 100 units of events, like record/run.

Example 5 records the behavior of 4*(dimerization#"A_PROTEIN")  on
file, like record.
